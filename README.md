## About the Book
This book discusses many strategies that can be used by developers to improve their DevSecOps and container security skills. It is intended for those who are active in software development. After reading this book, readers will discover how Docker and Kubernetes work from a security perspective.
 
The book begins with a discussion of the DevSecOps tools ecosystem, the primary container platforms and orchestration tools that you can use to manage the lifespan and security of your apps. Among other things, this book discusses best practices for constructing Docker images, discovering vulnerabilities, and better security. The book addresses how to examine container secrets and networking. Backed with examples, the book demonstrates how to manage and monitor container-based systems, including monitoring and administration in Docker.

In the final section, the book explains Kubernetes' architecture and the critical security threats inherent in its components. Towards the end, it demonstrates how to utilize Prometheus and Grafana to oversee observability and monitoring in Kubernetes management.
